# AI Summer Project 2025: Investigating Grokking Acceleration in Deep Neural Networks

## Project Overview
This project explores the effects of **gradient filtering** on **grokking acceleration** in deep neural networks. The goal is to analyze how filtering impacts **learning dynamics, feature rank evolution, and generalization**.

## Research Questions
- How does **gradient filtering** affect **grokking acceleration**?
- What impact does it have on **feature rank evolution**?
- Can it **enhance generalization** in deep learning models?

## Methodology
- **Model:** Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- **Dataset:** Modular arithmetic dataset
- **Key Experiment:** Compare a **baseline model** vs. a **filtered model** using accuracy analysis and feature rank evolution.
